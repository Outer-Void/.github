# Brand Manifesto

The Outer-Void brand is a promise: collaboration without compromise. Our voice, visuals, and interactions must reflect radical transparency, high craft, and the belief that people own their tools.

## Narrative Pillars

1. **Co-Creation as Ritual** – Every launch is an invitation to build together. Narratives celebrate shared authorship, spotlighting how [`blux-experience-kit`](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-experience-kit) prototypes transform into community-owned products.
2. **Visible Systems** – We show our scaffolding. From architectural diagrams to governance dashboards, communications cite source repositories like [`blux-core`](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-core) and [`blux-orbit`](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-orbit) to make complexity approachable.
3. **Sovereignty in Practice** – Messaging emphasizes opt-in consent, self-hosting pathways, and reversible integrations, referencing policies in the [Ethics Charter](ethics-charter.md).

## Voice and Tone

- **Transparent** – Explain the "why" behind choices, link to discussions, and invite scrutiny.
- **Empowering** – Highlight how individuals can remix, fork, or extend our tools.
- **Warmly Technical** – Balance engineering precision with human-centered storytelling.

## Visual Language

- **Palette** – Cosmic blues and orbiting gradients to symbolize shared gravity; neutrals ensure accessibility.
- **Typography** – Geometric sans-serif for clarity paired with monospace callouts for technical depth.
- **Iconography** – Modular constellations that can be recombined across repos, signaling interoperability.

## Experience Principles

- **Legibility First** – Interfaces default to high contrast, clear affordances, and contextual tips derived from [`blux-design-system`](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-design-system).
- **Composable Journeys** – Every touchpoint points to relevant repositories, encouraging contributors to navigate the full BLUX constellation.
- **Proof of Openness** – Product and marketing sites embed changelog feeds, governance snapshots, and links to the [Ecosystem Diagram](ecosystem-diagram.md).

## Brand Commitments

- Keep storytelling grounded in real contributor experiences.
- Celebrate transparency by linking to public RFCs, prototypes, and retrospectives.
- Use inclusive language that welcomes co-creation across cultures and disciplines.

By honoring this manifesto, every BLUX impression reinforces trust, shared ownership, and the joy of building together.
