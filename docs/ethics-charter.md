# Ethics Charter

The BLUX ecosystem thrives when every participant can collaborate safely, transparently, and with full agency. This charter codifies the commitments that guide our decisions and interpersonal conduct.

## Core Principles

1. **Transparency Over Convenience** – We prefer explicit communication and auditable systems even when automation could obscure context. Every algorithmic decision must have an accessible explanation pathway.
2. **Sovereign Participation** – Contributors choose their involvement level, retain rights to their creative output, and can exit without data lock-in.
3. **Mutual Accountability** – All teams publish agreements, milestones, and retrospectives in shared workspaces. Feedback is a collective responsibility, not a managerial privilege.
4. **Inclusive Access** – Products and processes must be accessible across abilities, geographies, and languages. We prioritize universal design standards and community localization.
5. **Safety and Respect** – Harassment, discrimination, or exploitation are never tolerated. Reports trigger transparent restorative processes with clear timelines.

## Operational Policies

### Open Decision-Making

- Governance proposals originate in public issue threads within [`blux-governance`](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-governance) and remain open for at least seven days.
- Votes and endorsements are recorded on-chain or in auditable ledgers with accessible summaries.
- Breaking changes across repositories require multi-repo RFCs with stewards from [`blux-core`](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-core) and [`blux-orbit`](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-orbit).

### Data Stewardship

- Personal data is collected only with explicit, documented consent. Opt-out pathways are always visible inside [`blux-experience-kit`](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-experience-kit).
- Telemetry defaults to off. Any opt-in data flow must enumerate recipients, retention timelines, and deletion procedures.
- Shared datasets are licensed to preserve contributor attribution and limitations.

### Collaboration Agreements

- Working groups publish charters that specify scope, decision rituals, and conflict escalation processes.
- All synchronous meetings are paired with asynchronous notes to keep remote members in sync.
- Design artifacts from [`blux-design-system`](https://github.com/Outer-Void/blux-design-system) include accessibility annotations and localization guidance.

### Conflict Transformation

- Conflicts are addressed through mediated conversations documented in the relevant repository.
- We prioritize restoration and learning over punitive measures, except in cases of repeated harm.
- Contributors can appeal decisions to an independent council drawn from three separate BLUX repositories.

## Upholding the Charter

- Annual audits review how faithfully projects align with these commitments and recommend updates.
- Amendments require consensus across maintainers of all BLUX repositories listed in the [ecosystem diagram](ecosystem-diagram.md).
- Violations may result in temporary suspension of repository access until restorative actions are complete.

We invite every participant to reference this charter when making design choices, reviewing code, or moderating community spaces.
