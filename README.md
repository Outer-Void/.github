# Outer-Void Organizational Hub

Welcome to the coordination hub for the [Outer-Void](https://github.com/Outer-Void) collective. This repository curates shared doctrine, design language, and collaborative agreements that guide every project in the BLUX ecosystem. It is the single point of reference for:

- the mission that anchors our strategy and partnerships;
- the ethics charter that protects contributors, users, and communities;
- the brand manifesto that keeps our voice coherent across mediums; and
- the evolving ecosystem map that orients new collaborators.

## Quick Navigation

| Artifact | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Mission Statement](docs/mission.md) | Why we build, who we serve, and how we measure impact. |
| [Ethics Charter](docs/ethics-charter.md) | Shared guardrails that define transparent, sovereign-friendly collaboration. |
| [Brand Manifesto](docs/brand-manifesto.md) | Narrative, tone, and visual cues that embody BLUX values. |
| [Ecosystem Diagram](docs/ecosystem-diagram.md) | Visual map of the BLUX product constellation and dependencies. |

## Collaboration Principles

- **Open by Default** – Plans, discussions, and decision logs belong in public issues whenever possible.
- **Interdependent Craft** – Teams share primitives, design libraries, and research across repositories before reinventing solutions.
- **Personal Sovereignty** – Contributors retain ownership of their workflows and data; opt-in consent is required for any telemetry or automation.

## BLUX Ecosystem Repositories
